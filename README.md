1. I can see there are duplicate full names with different img angles. 
2. I assumed that all the full names should be shown as a list (even if they are duplicate names). 
3. In the future I would go through the json object to see if there are any duplicate names and create arrays for each and add the respective images inside(so have a list of images per full_name)
4. Used jest to test whether the right data is obtained
